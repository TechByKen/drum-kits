#Drum kits
A html css and JavaScript project

#html
I created a h1 tag bearing the title of the project;
Div with a class of container that contains the drum kits

#css
I styled the body, h1, container and btn using css properties.

#JavaScript
I created an array kit that holds the images of each drum kit. I dynamically created the button elements using document.createElement and append it to the parent container. I added an eventlistener with click as event handler on the button elements. I put an animation using style.transform to the button container and also a setTimeOut.
